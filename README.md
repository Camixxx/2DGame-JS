# 2DGame-JS
this is 2d game prototype from group two in NUS
# Anti Gravity

If you want to survive, just rush to the front direction! You can use "WASD" to control ,and the "Space" button will change your gravity! Find your way to deal with the block which is flying towards you constantly...or you will be pushed down and die.


It maybe takes some time to open it..because the musics and images is very large.And reallly appreciate the artist who provided these beausiful backgrounds!
